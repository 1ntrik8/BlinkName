# BlinkName
SIT210 - Task 2.1P

In this task, we will start basic programming with Particle devices.
Please note: While we may refer to particle Photon in the document, the programing and steps are similar for most particle devices.

Steps:
1. Particle group has provided a nice example on how to write a program to make a Photon blink itâ€™s LED on pin D7. Read the tutorial available here: https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/
a. Note that the LED pin could be different in other Particle devices.

2. Modify your Blink an LED code to repeatedly blink your first name in Morse code. (Morse code look up here: https://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse2.html . Using a long blink for a line and a short blink for a dot).
